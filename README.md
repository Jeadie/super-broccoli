# Super Broccoli
Multivariate regression models with basic serialisation types. 

## About
super-broccoli is currently under production but has a C++ implementation of a multivariate linear regression model. The current implementation is built upon GNU's scientific library. With this, the current stage of the repo is to create persistent storage for these trained models. An abstract save strategy design pattern is used with a virtual interface to build specific save formats upon.
